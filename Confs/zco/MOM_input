! This input file provides the adjustable run-time parameters for version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model (MOM6).
! Where appropriate, parameters use usually given in MKS units.

! This particular file is for the example in ISOMIP/layer.

! This MOM_input file typically contains only the non-default values that are needed to reproduce this example.

                                ! further run is required to complete the simulation. If automatic restarts are
                                ! not desired, use a negative value for MAXCPU.  MAXCPU has units of wall-clock
                                ! seconds, so the actual CPU time used is larger by a factor of the number of
